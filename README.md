# ArtifactGame
ArtifactGame is a dynamic, interactive 2D game built with Python using the Pygame library. In this game, players navigate through a grid-based environment to collect artifacts while avoiding enemies and solving strategic challenges.

🕹️ Game Overview
Players take control of a character on a tile-based map and must:

🧭 Move strategically to collect all artifacts

👾 Avoid AI-controlled enemies with random or smart movement patterns

🧠 Make decisions quickly as the map and enemy behaviors evolve

The game blends elements of puzzle-solving, exploration, and survival within a compact Pygame-powered framework.
